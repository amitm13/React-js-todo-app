## Overview

This is a simple To-Do app built with React JS. It allows you to manage your tasks by adding, marking as completed, undoing completion, and deleting items from the to-do list.

## Features

### 1. Add an item to the to-do list

Easily add new tasks to your to-do list. Simply enter the task in the input field and press the "Add" button. The new task will be added to the list.

### 2. Mark the item as completed and undo completion

Keep track of completed tasks by marking them as done. Click on a task to mark it as completed. If you accidentally mark a task as done, you can undo the completion by clicking on it again.

### 3. Delete items from the to-do list

Remove tasks that you no longer need by clicking on the delete button next to the task. This helps you keep your to-do list organized and clutter-free.
